# mDNS-SD
mDNS- is a simple mDNS-SD browser inspired from from https://github.com/sudomesh/mdnssd-min
It has been updated to compile under Linux, OSX and Windows and split into a library and a test program so that it can be included into various project.
Makefile are for Linux (x86 and ARM) and OSX. Under Windows I use Embarcadero C++, so I don't use makefile
